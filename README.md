# My Mini Project in C
## This is the mini project: "Implementation of ATM machine using C" that I made in first semester.

## -> WARNING AND IMPORTANT POINTS: 
### 1. MUST INCLUDE 'gotoxy.h' header file in the same directory if you are running in the codeblocks environment 
### 2. DO NO COPY PASTE DIRECTLY IN LINUX ENVIRONMENT , though can run in linux environment with minor modifications.
### 3. WHILE RUNNING THIS CODE THE PIN, CARD NUMBER USED ARE ALREADY PREDEFINED SO ONE MUST CHECK THE SCREENSHOTS FOR THE CORRECT ONES.

## -> Concepts Used
This mini project is totally based on the simple if else , loop , switches that one can implement easily.
